baba ate crocodile and slept in a cage
when asked he denied it
but now the whole village is aware
\how did you do it they asked?
quiet easily if iam being honest
I have dreamt of eating it for as long as |I can remember
so when the opportunity came, I snuck up on it
hit its head with a stick
and cooked it with spices i bought from the market
